# Contributing guide

Thank you for considering to contribute, you are awesome! :heart:

Please familiarize yourself with the guidelines summarized below for optimal collaboration.

## Open an issue first

If you would like to change something, open an issue first. It allows discussing the context and designing a solution _before_ most of the effort is spent on the implementation.

## Avoid duplicate issues

Check already existing issues about the same topic before opening a new one.

## Send pull requests

The preferred way to receive changes is via pull requests against the default branch.

## Use draft pull requests

Open [draft pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) to take advantage of automated tests and to share ideas early without triggering a review. Mark it ready for review when it's done, or ask for help directly when stuck.

## Ensure tests pass

The automated test suite of the repository should pass all tests before a review is considered.

## Test first, code later

If there is a test suite, demonstrate the idea by adding a new test which fails at that point. Push it in a new branch as the first commit.

Then implement the solution that makes the failing test pass. Push that as a second commit.

## Keep the code tidy

Keep the relevant linters happy. If in doubt, follow the feedback of the automated tests, or the style of the existing code.

## Use well-written commit messages

Follow [The seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules). If in doubt, check the existing commit messages and copy their style.

## Keep a clean history

Make exactly one commit for each logical change. Clean up the history before asking for review.
